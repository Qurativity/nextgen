personally experienced significant symptoms of burnout in my very first year of
full time Radiology practice, after 14 years of study, including medical school, residency and fellowship.  The medical system should support practitioners
to lead by example, but instead, our current model challenges all aspects of our
physical, emotional and spiritual health. The medical community
is not alone in its
vulnerability
to burnout and compassion fatigue.  As a society we are more exhausted, anxious and burned out than ever before.   We glorify an unsustainable level of “workaholism” and create an unhealthy environment where we are expected to function optimally.  We have the research to support a better approach to wellness, yet the old mindset and ingrained values hold us back from leveraging our greatest potential as healers and leaders. It is my passion to inspire the implementation of </span><span class="about-section5__big-title-span1">mindful </span><span class="about-section5__big-title-span2">and</span><span class="about-section5__big-title-span3"> heartful</span><span class="about-section5__big-title-span4"> strategies in healthcare, organizations and community, to support individual and collective health.

The more we begin operating as a society that understands how personal health affects our collective well being, the more we will be able to nurture these connections, address the rampant burnout, anxiety and depression in our society today, and come together in our common humanity.</span></pre>

Dr. Mitchell Abrams is a Canadian Radiologist, keynote speaker, teacher and founder of NexGenHealth Ltd..  Abrams completed his medical degree and 

radiology specialty from Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, holds a subspecialty in Cross Sectional Imaging from the University of Toronto and is a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Dr. Abrams is an Associate Professor at Michael G Degroote School of Medical Sciences and was Interim Department Chair of Diagnostic Imaging at Cambridge Memorial Hospital.  As part of a social impact initiative, Dr. Abrams is currently leading a capstone project (through Stanford University&#x27;s Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education in the School of Medicine, Department of Neurosurgery) to create a sustainable fundraising model in support of mental health and resilience training for youth education, communities in need, and to support clinical research. This model leverages art, music and technology as tools to educate, heal and inspire.

Early in his radiology career, Dr. Abrams was diagnosed with Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy, a disease that can lead to sudden cardiac death in seemingly fit and healthy young people. He required open heart surgery in order to prevent the worst-case scenario. It was this experience as patient, coupled with his roles as physician and department chair, that provided him with an intimate view of the inner workings of our healthcare system. He became acutely aware of the limitations and gaps in our current model of care. This realization became a passion and drove him down a path of research and experiential learning with experts around the globe, looking at different approaches to healing. In particular, Dr. Mitch’s background in radiology and his understanding of physics, supported a deep investigation into the nature of energy and how we best thrive. The intersection between his life in science and this powerful experience with healing, provided the foundation of what his life-mission has become - to support and promote a more holistic model of healthcare. As part of his mission, Dr. Mitch founded NexGenHealth: a social enterprise to bring forth a new paradigm in self-care, patient care, and community wellness. </pre
